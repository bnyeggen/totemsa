History:
Started based on the SICP symbolic differentiation chapter, with some extensions.
Brought into Incanter, additions made by David Edgar Liebke.
Now, split back into its own project to support a more rapid development cycle,
the addition of unit tests & generative testing, expression simplification, etc.

Please don't actually use this until the tests pass.
